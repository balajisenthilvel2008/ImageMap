            <p>"Annapoorneshwari Palace" can refer to two different places: a temple in Horanadu, Karnataka or a venue in Hosur used for events like expos and festivals. The Horanadu temple is dedicated to the goddess Annapoorneshwari and is located in the Western Ghats. The Hosur location is a modern venue for public and private events, with no religious significance. </p>
